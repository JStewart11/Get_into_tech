# it has counted the letters in Hello using the length function - returns the number 5
tup = 'Hello'
print(len(tup))

# there is a comma at the end of Hello which means the code sees it as one item
# comma changed it to a TUPLE
tup = 'Hello',
print(len(tup))
# this prints 1, as one item in the tuple
# a comma makes a tuple, a tuple
